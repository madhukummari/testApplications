# Docker Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. What is layer caching in Docker?
**Answer:** Layer caching allows Docker to reuse unchanged layers from previous builds to speed up the build process and reduce unnecessary computation.

## 2. How does modifying a layer affect the subsequent layers?
**Answer:** When a layer is modified, all subsequent layers must be rebuilt because Docker's caching mechanism works from top to bottom.

## 3. Why should we use a non-root user in Docker containers?
**Answer:** Running as a non-root user improves security by limiting the impact of potential vulnerabilities, preventing unauthorized access to the host system.

## 4. How does `.dockerignore` improve build efficiency?
**Answer:** The `.dockerignore` file excludes unnecessary files (e.g., logs, `node_modules`, `.git`) from the build context, reducing image size and speeding up the build process.

## 5. What is a multi-stage build in Docker?
**Answer:** A multi-stage build uses multiple `FROM` statements in a Dockerfile, allowing different stages for building and running the application, leading to smaller final images.

## 6. How does a multi-stage build reduce image size?
**Answer:** By only copying necessary artifacts from the build stage to the final image, multi-stage builds exclude unnecessary dependencies and tools.

## 7. Why should we separate build dependencies from runtime dependencies?
**Answer:** Build dependencies (e.g., compilers) are only needed during build time and should be excluded from runtime to reduce attack surface and image size.

## 8. What is Docker Compose?
**Answer:** Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container applications using a YAML configuration file.

## 9. How do you define service dependencies in Docker Compose?
**Answer:** Using `depends_on` in the `docker-compose.yml` file ensures that one service starts only after another service has been initialized.

## 10. What are the benefits of using volumes in Docker?
**Answer:** Volumes provide persistent storage, enabling data to persist across container restarts and improving performance compared to bind mounts.

## 11. How do you scale services in Docker Compose?
**Answer:** Using the `docker-compose up --scale service_name=num` command allows horizontal scaling of services by running multiple instances.

## 12. How do you debug a failing container?
**Answer:** Use `docker logs <container_id>` to check logs, `docker inspect` for configuration details, and `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh` to enter a running container.

## 13. What command helps inspect container logs?
**Answer:** The `docker logs <container_id>` command displays logs generated by a running container.

## 14. How can you enter a running containerâ€™s shell?
**Answer:** Using `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh` or `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash` allows access to the container's interactive shell.
