# Kubernetes (K8s) - Introduction & Features

## ðŸ“Œ What is Kubernetes (K8s)?
Kubernetes (K8s) is an **open-source container orchestration platform** that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps manage workloads efficiently across multiple machines.

Originally developed by **Google**, Kubernetes is now maintained by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**.

## ðŸš€ Why Kubernetes?
Modern applications are often built using **microservices and containers (Docker)**. Managing these containers manually across multiple servers is complex. Kubernetes provides a solution by:

âœ… **Automating Deployment & Scaling** - No need to manually start/stop containers.  
âœ… **Self-Healing** - If a container crashes, Kubernetes restarts it automatically.  
âœ… **Efficient Resource Utilization** - Optimizes CPU & memory across multiple nodes.  
âœ… **Rolling Updates & Rollbacks** - Deploy new versions without downtime.  
âœ… **Portability & Flexibility** - Runs on any cloud provider or on-premises.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features of Kubernetes

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Automated Scaling
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** adjusts the number of running pods based on CPU/memory usage.  
- **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)** adjusts resource limits for pods.  
- **Cluster Autoscaler** scales the cluster up/down by adding or removing nodes.  

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Service Discovery & Load Balancing
- Built-in **DNS-based service discovery**.  
- **LoadBalancer and Ingress Controllers** handle external traffic routing.  

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Self-Healing
- Restarts failed containers automatically.  
- Replaces & reschedules containers when a node fails.  

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Declarative Configuration & Automation
- Uses **YAML manifests** to define application state.  
- Works with **GitOps tools** like ArgoCD & FluxCD.  

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Security & Access Control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage permissions.  
- **Pod Security Policies & Network Policies** to control traffic flow.  

### ðŸ”¹ 6. Persistent Storage
- Supports **Persistent Volumes (PV) & Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**.  
- Works with cloud storage (AWS EBS, Azure Disks, Google Persistent Disk).  

### ðŸ”¹ 7. Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Cloud Support
- Runs on **AWS, GCP, Azure, On-Prem, or Bare Metal**.  
- Tools like **Anthos, OpenShift, and Rancher** help manage hybrid environments.

## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion
Kubernetes is essential for **scaling, automating, and managing** modern applications in production. Whether you're running on **AWS, GCP, or on-prem**, Kubernetes ensures your apps are highly available, scalable, and resilient. ðŸš€
